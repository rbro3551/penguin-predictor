# penguin-predictor

This is a web app built using the streamlit library that uses machine learning to predict the species of penguin based on a number of user inputs (ex. bill depth/length). The user can input these using the programmed sliders or by uploading a csv of their own. The app has a base dataset to use for its predictions. The output shows the species prediction along with the relative probabilty for each species (0: Adelie, 1: Chinstrap, 2: Gentoo)
